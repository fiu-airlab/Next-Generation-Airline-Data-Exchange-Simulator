# Next-Generation-Airline-Data-Exchange-Simulator
The goal of this project is to develop an open source web-based live simulator that will serve as a testing environment to experiment and validate on IATAâ€™s NDC standard. This project is composed of two main goals, (1) build a primitive OTA and set up an NDC connection between a simulated travel agent and an airline and (2) generate the synthetic data necessary to display in the primitive OTA. Our vision is for the NGADS platform to eventually become an essential training tool for airlines to explore the capabilities provided by NDC.
